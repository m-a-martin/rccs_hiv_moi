    abstract = "{Understanding genetic variation in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is clinically and immunologically important for patient treatment and vaccine development. We investigated the longitudinal intra-host genetic variation of HIV in over 3,000 individuals in the US National HIV Surveillance System with at least four reported HIV-1 polymerase (pol) sequences. In this population, we identified 149 putative instances of superinfection (i.e. an individual sequentially infected with genetically divergent, polyphyletic viruses). Unexpectedly, we discovered a group of 240 individuals with consecutively sampled viral strains that were \&gt;0.015 substitutions/site divergent, despite remaining monophyletic in the phylogeny. Viruses in some of these individuals had a maximum genetic divergence approaching that found between two random, unrelated HIV-1 subtype-B pol sequences within the US population. Individuals with these highly divergent viruses tended to be diagnosed nearly a decade earlier in the epidemic than people with superinfection or virus with less intra-host genetic variation, and they had distinct transmission risk factor profiles. To better understand this genetic variation in cases with extremely divergent, monophyletic viruses, we performed molecular clock phylogenetic analysis. Our findings suggest that, like Hepatitis C virus, extremely divergent HIV lineages can be maintained within an individual and reemerge over a period of years.}",

    abstract = "{After acute HIV infection, CD8+ T cells are able to control viral replication to a set point. This control is often lost after superinfection, although the mechanism behind this remains unclear. In this study, we illustrate in an HLA-B27+ subject that loss of viral control after HIV superinfection coincides with rapid recombination events within two narrow regions of Gag and Env. Screening for CD8+ T cell responses revealed that each of these recombination sites (∼50 aa) encompassed distinct regions containing two immunodominant CD8 epitopes (B27-KK10 in Gag and Cw1-CL9 in Env). Viral escape and the subsequent development of variant-specific de novo CD8+ T cell responses against both epitopes were illustrative of the significant immune selection pressures exerted by both responses. Comprehensive analysis of the kinetics of CD8 responses and viral evolution indicated that the recombination events quickly facilitated viral escape from both dominant WT- and variant-specific responses. These data suggest that the ability of a superinfecting strain of HIV to overcome preexisting immune control may be related to its ability to rapidly recombine in critical regions under immune selection pressure. These data also support a role for cellular immune pressures in driving the selection of new recombinant forms of HIV. }",

To increase our understanding of the importance of these recombinants, we assessed recombination within an individual infected from a single source by studying the linkage patterns of the auxiliary genes of HIV-1 subtype B. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic techniques revealed evidence for recombination from topological incongruence among adjacent genes. Coalescent methods were then used to estimate the in vivo recombination rate. The estimated mean rate of 1.38 × 10−4 recombination events/adjacent sites/generation is ∼5.5-fold greater than the reported point mutation rate of 2.5 × 10−5/site/generation. Recombination was found to be frequent enough to mask evidence for purifying selection by Tajima's D test. Thus, recombination is a major evolutionary force affecting genetic variation within an HIV-1-infected individual, of the same order of magnitude as point mutational change.}",

            Recombination in {HIV}-1 is well documented, but its importance in the low-diversity setting of within-host diversification is less understood. Here we develop a novel computational tool ({RAPR} (Recombination Analysis {PRogram})) to enable a detailed view of in vivo viral recombination during early infection, and we apply it to near-full-length {HIV}-1 genome sequences from longitudinal samples. Recombinant genomes rapidly replace transmitted/founder (T/F) lineages, with a median half-time of 27 days, increasing the genetic complexity of the viral population. We identify recombination hot and cold spots that differ from those observed in inter-subtype recombinants. Furthermore, {RAPR} analysis of longitudinal samples from an individual with well-characterized neutralizing antibody responses shows that recombination helps carry forward resistance-conferring mutations in the diversifying quasispecies. These findings provide insight into molecular mechanisms by which viral recombination contributes to {HIV}-1 persistence and immunopathogenesis and have implications for studies of {HIV} transmission and evolution in vivo.},

HIV-1 env C2-C4 PCR products generated from 48 serum samples isolated from 24 HIV-1 positive and therapy-naïve homosexual men at seroconversion and at approximately 1 year thereafter were subjected to HMA and population sequencing. Clonal sequence analysis was used to determine the sensitivity of each method to detect sequence variability. Results from HMA were compared to pairwise genetic distance of clonal sequences; heteroduplexes resulted from as little as 1.4% pairwise distance between two sequences and were detected even when only 1.5% of the pairwise distance comparisons exceeded this distance threshold. By contrast, the ambiguity code approach using population-based sequencing detected only 20.1% of existing sequence variation and was less sensitive to minority populations ≤20%, resulting in an underestimation of HIV-1 diversity. Thus, HMA was found to be more sensitive for detection of sequence variations than the ambiguity code approach, suggesting that HMA would be a more appropriate method to pre-screen for HIV-1 superinfection.}

The occurrence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) dual infections in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, was examined during 2003–2007 to investigate whether the number of HIV-1 dual infections increased as the number of HIV-1 infected individuals increased during the same period.Methods. All first HIV-1 genotyping sequences obtained from 2003 through 2007 were retrieved and examined for the number of degenerate base codes in the reverse-transcriptase fragment. A total of 72 patients had ⩾34 degenerate base codes; for these patients, a fragment of the V3-V4 region of the env gene was amplified, cloned, and sequenced to verify the presence of an HIV-1 dual infection. The number of dual infections were counted for each year investigated.Results. No significant change in the incidence of dual infections was observed in our population of patients, who were selected on the basis of the number of degenerate base codes in each patient's first HIV-1 sequence obtained from 2003 through 2007. The frequency of HIV-1 dual infections varied between 1.0\\% and 2.4\\% each year, with no significant trend over time (P=.49). Patients with HIV-1 dual infections were similar to patients with single HIV-1 infections in The Netherlands with regard to distribution of risk group, sex, and HIV subtype.Conclusion. The proportion of HIV-1 dual infections in The Netherlands did not increase from 2003 through 2007, although the HIV-1–infected population expanded in this period.}",

However, data on changes in population prevalence of HIV infection and HIV incidence within occupations following mass scale-up of African HIV treatment and prevention programs is very limited. We evaluated prospective data collected between 1999 and 2016 from the Rakai Community Cohort Study, a longitudinal population-based study of 15- to 49-year-old persons in Uganda. Adjusted prevalence risk ratios for overall, treated, and untreated, prevalent HIV infection, and incidence rate ratios for HIV incidence with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Poisson regression to assess changes in HIV outcomes by occupation. Analyses were stratified by gender. There were 33,866 participants, including 19,113 (56%) women. Overall, HIV seroprevalence declined in most occupational subgroups among men, but increased or remained mostly stable among women. In contrast, prevalence of untreated HIV substantially declined between 1999 and 2016 in most occupations, irrespective of gender, including by 70% among men (12.3 to 4.2%; adjPRR = 0.30; 95%CI:0.23–0.41) and by 78% among women (14.7 to 4.0%; adjPRR = 0.22; 95%CI:0.18–0.27) working in agriculture, the most common self-reported primary occupation. Exceptions included men working in transportation. HIV incidence similarly declined in most occupations, but there were no reductions in incidence among female bar and restaurant workers, women working in local crafts, or men working in transportation. In summary, untreated HIV infection and HIV incidence have declined within most occupational groups in Uganda. However, women working in bars/restaurants and local crafts and men working in transportation continue to have a relatively high burden of untreated HIV and HIV incidence, and as such, should be considered priority populations for HIV programming.},

Ongoing high-risk behaviours can lead to {HCV} re-exposure, resulting in mixed {HCV} infection and reinfection. Assays used to screen for mixed infection vary widely in sensitivity, particularly with respect to their capacity for detecting minor variants ({\textless}20\% of the viral population). The prevalence of mixed infection among {PWID} ranges from 14\% to 39\% when sensitive assays are used. Mixed infection compromises {HCV} treatment outcomes with interferon-based regimens. {HCV} reinfection can also occur after successful interferon-based treatment among {PWID}, but the rate of reinfection is low (0–5 cases per 100 person-years). A revolution in {HCV} therapeutic development has occurred in the past few years, with the advent of interferon-free, but still genotype-specific regiments based on direct acting antiviral agents. However, little is known about whether mixed infection and reinfection has an effect on {HCV} treatment outcomes in the setting of new direct-acting antiviral agents. This Review characterizes the epidemiology and natural history of mixed infection and reinfection among {PWID}, methodologies for detection, the potential implications for {HCV} treatment and considerations for the design of future studies.},

	abstract = {Background Longitudinal data on the population prevalence of HIV drug resistance during scale-up of HIV treatment in Africa are extremely limited. We estimated trends in HIV drug resistance prevalence during ART program expansion from a population-based surveillance cohort in southern Uganda.Methods We analyzed data from Rakai Community Cohort Study participants aged 15-49 during four survey rounds conducted between 2012 (round 15) and 2019 (round 19). Consenting participants were tested for HIV and completed questionnaires. Persons living with HIV (PLHIV) provided samples for viral load quantification and virus deep-sequencing. Sequence data were used to predict resistance profiles. The prevalence of class-specific resistance and resistance-conferring substitutions were estimated using robust log-Poisson regression.Findings 93,659 participant visits were contributed between 2012 and 2019, including 17,471 (18.65\%) from PLHIV. Using deep-sequencing data from 3,713 pre-treatment participant-visits we estimated that the population prevalence of viremic NNRTI, NRTI, and PI resistance decreased significantly between 2012 and 2017 (PR = 0.38, 95\% CI 0.25 {\textendash} 0.57; 0.20, 95\% CI 0.09 {\textendash} 0.45; 0.19, 95\% CI 0.09 {\textendash} 0.39, respectively) with increasing viral suppression. Among viremic pre-treatment PLHIV, the prevalence of NNRTI resistance increased two-fold (PR = 1.96, 95\% CI 1.31-2.95) to 9.77\% (7.35\% - 12.97\%) over the same time period. We did not observe an increase in NRTI or PI resistance in this population. The 2017 prevalence of NNRTI and NRTI resistance among viremic treatment-experienced PLHIV was 47.67\% (95\% CI 40.94\% - 55.50\%) and 36.55\% (95\% CI 30.14\% - 44.31\%), respectively. Single-class resistance predominated among resistant pre-treatment PLHIV (83.05\%) whereas most treatment-experienced resistance was multi-class (76.65\%). In 2017, 10.13\% (95\% CI 7.83\%-13.63\%) and 9.98\% (95\% CI 6.43\%-15.51\%) of viremic pre-treatment and treatment-experienced PLHIV harbored the inT97A mutation.Interpretation Prevalence of HIV drug resistance among viremic PLHIV significantly increased with scale-up of ART programs. The prevalence of inT97A is potentially concerning considering the recent roll-out of dolutegravir-based regimens.Funding National Institutes of Health, the Bill \&amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and the U.S. President{\textquoteright}s Emergence Plan for AIDS Relief through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Evidence before the study We searched PubMed for studies matching the keywords {\textquotedblleft}hiv{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}resistance{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}longitudinal{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}cohort{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}population{\textquotedblright} published since 2004 (the beginning of antiretroviral therapy (ART) availability in sub-Saharan Africa) and identified 48 studies. We excluded 33 studies not based in sub-Saharan Africa, four studies primarily concerned with coinfection with other pathogens (e.g. HBV, M. tuberculosis), two studies concerned with insulin resistance, one sequencing-methods paper, and one paper concerned with host susceptibility to HIV infection. The remaining seven studies were not population-based meaning that the study population was not all persons but e.g. people living with HIV enrolled in care at a given clinic. We identified no previous longitudinal population-based cohort studies of HIV ART resistance in sub-Saharan Africa.Added value of this study We estimated the prevalence of drug resistance over four survey rounds of a population-based open-cohort study in southern Uganda between 2012 and 2019 during a period of intense treatment scale-up. We show that pre-treatment resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) among pre-treatment PLHIV increased significantly during the scale-up of ART. We further show that among viremic treatment-experienced individuals 48\% and 37\% harbored resistance to NNRTIs and nucleoside-reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), the majority of which harbored multiclass resistance. While drug resistance among people living with viremic HIV increased, the overall prevalence of viremic HIV drug resistance in the population decreased by about two-thirds due to increasing population viral load suppression. The most common resistance mutation in our population was inT97A, a known compensatory mutation for integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) resistance. In contrast to other mutations, presence of inT97A did not depend on treatment status.These results provide the first longitudinal population-based estimates of temporal trends in the prevalence of drug resistance during ART program expansion in a high-burden setting. Further, they provide critical insight into the landscape of prevalent drug resistance substitutions circulating in this population.Implications of all the available evidence Scale-up of HIV treatment has increased the prevalence of drug resistance mutations among viremic people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The relatively high prevalence of NNRTI resistance has prompted a recent shift to first-line regimens including dolutegravir (an INSTI) in combination with NRTIs. The high prevalence of an INSTI compensatory mutation in our population further warrants continuing monitoring of treatment failures and the prevalence of drug resistance in high burden settings.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe thank the Rakai Health Sciences Program and the participants of the Rakai Community Cohort Study for making this research possible.

            {HIV} prevalence varies markedly throughout Africa, and it is often presumed areas of higher {HIV} prevalence (i.e., hotspots) serve as sources of infection to neighboring areas of lower prevalence. However, the small-scale geography of migration networks and movement of {HIV}-positive individuals between communities is poorly understood. Here, we use population-based data from {\textasciitilde}22,000 persons of known {HIV} status to characterize migratory patterns and their relationship to {HIV} among 38 communities in Rakai, Uganda with {HIV} prevalence ranging from 9 to 43\%. We find that migrants moving into hotspots had significantly higher {HIV} prevalence than migrants moving elsewhere, but out-migration from hotspots was geographically dispersed, contributing minimally to {HIV} burden in destination locations. Our results challenge the assumption that high prevalence hotspots are drivers of transmission in regional epidemics, instead suggesting that migrants with high {HIV} prevalence, particularly women, selectively migrate to these areas.},

	abstract = {Background. Human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 ({HIV}-1) dual infection ({DI}) has been associated with decreased {CD}4 T-cell counts and increased viral loads; however, the frequency of intrasubtype {DI} is poorly understood. We used ultradeep sequencing ({UDS}) to estimate the frequency of {DI} in a primary infection cohort of predominantly men who have sex with men ({MSM}).
Methods. {HIV}-1 genomes from longitudinal blood samples of recently infected, therapy-naive participants were interrogated with {UDS}. {DI} was conﬁrmed when maximum sequence divergence was excessive and supported by phylogenetic analysis. Coinfection was deﬁned as {DI} at baseline; superinfection was monoinfection at baseline and {DI} at a later time point.
Results. Of 118 participants, 7 were coinfected and 10 acquired superinfection. Superinfection incidence rate was 4.96 per 100 person-years (95\% conﬁdence interval [{CI}], 2.67–9.22); 6 occurred in the ﬁrst year and 4 in the second. Overall cumulative prevalence of intrasubtype B {DI} was 14.4\% (95\% {CI}, 8.6\%−22.1\%). Primary {HIV}-1 incidence was 4.37 per 100 person-years (95\% {CI}, 3.56–5.36).
Conclusions. Intrasubtype {DI} was frequent and comparable to primary infection rates among {MSM} in San Diego; however, superinfection rates declined over time. {DI} is likely an important component of the {HIV} epidemic dynamics, and development of stronger immune responses to the initial infection may protect from superinfection.},

Design—We compared clinical, virologic, and immunologic factors between participants who were dually infected with {HIV}-1 subtype B, and monoinfected ({MI}) controls who were matched by ongoing {HIV} risk factor.
Methods—The viral load and {CD}4 progressions of dually and singly infected participant groups were compared with linear mixed-effects models, and individual dynamics before and after superinfection were assessed with a structural change test (Chow test). Recombination breakpoint analysis ({GARD}), {HLA} frequency analysis, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte ({CTL}) epitope mapping were also performed ({HIV} {LANL} Database).
Results—The viral loads of {DI} participants increased more over 3 years of follow-up than the viral loads of {MI} controls, while {CD}4 progressions of the two groups did not differ. Viral escape from {CTL} responses following superinfection was observed in two participants whose superinfecting strain completely replaced the initial strain. This pattern was not seen among participants whose superinfecting virus persisted in a recombinant form with the initial virus or was only detected transiently. Several {HLA} types were overrepresented in {DI} participants as compared to {MI} controls.
Conclusions—These results identify potential factors for {DI} susceptibility and further define its clinical consequences.},

Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.}

Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find {ML} trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available {ML} programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same {CPU} time as {RAxML} and {PhyML}, then our software {IQ}-{TREE} found higher likelihoods between 62.2\% and 87.1\% of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the {IQ}-{TREE} stopping rule, {RAxML} and {PhyML} are faster in 75.7\% and 47.1\% of the {DNA} alignments and 42.2\% and 100\% of the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods with {IQ}-{TREE} improves to 73.3-97.1\%. {IQ}-{TREE} is freely available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree.},

(ii) We propose a simplified scoring system that performs well for reducing {CPU} time and increasing the accuracy of alignments even for sequences having large insertions or extensions as well as distantly related sequences of similar length. Two different heuristics, the progressive method ({FFT}-{NS}-2) and the iterative refinement method ({FFT}-{NS}-i), are implemented in {MAFFT}. The performances of {FFT}-{NS}-2 and {FFT}-{NS}-i were compared with other methods by computer simulations and benchmark tests; the {CPU} time of {FFT}-{NS}-2 is drastically reduced as compared with {CLUSTALW} with comparable accuracy. {FFT}-{NS}-i is over 100 times faster than T-{COFFEE}, when the number of input sequences exceeds 60, without sacrificing the accuracy.},

	abstract = {Human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 ({HIV}-1) group M is responsible for the current {AIDS} pandemic and exhibits exceedingly high levels of viral genetic diversity around the world, necessitating categorization of viruses into distinct lineages, or subtypes. These subtypes can differ by around 35\% in the envelope (Env) glycoproteins of the virus, which are displayed on the surface of the virion and are targets for both neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. This diversity reﬂects the remarkable ability of the virus to adapt to selective pressures, the bulk of which is applied by the host immune response, and represents a serious obstacle for developing an effective vaccine with broad coverage. Thus, it is important to understand the underlying biological consequences of intersubtype diversity. Recent studies have revealed that some of the {HIV}-1 subtypes exhibit phenotypic differences stemming from subtle changes in Env structure, particularly within the highly immunogenic V3 domain, which participates directly in viral entry. This review will therefore explore current research that describes subtype differences in Env at the genetic and phenotypic level, focusing in particular on V3, and highlighting recent discoveries about the unique features of subtype C Env, which is the most globally prevalent subtype.},

            To prevent new infections with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV}-1) in sub-Saharan Africa, {UNAIDS} recommends targeting interventions to populations that are at high risk of acquiring and passing on the virus. Yet it is often unclear who and where these ‘source’ populations are. Here we demonstrate how viral deep-sequencing can be used to reconstruct {HIV}-1 transmission networks and to infer the direction of transmission in these networks. We are able to deep-sequence virus from a large population-based sample of infected individuals in Rakai District, Uganda, reconstruct partial transmission networks, and infer the direction of transmission within them at an estimated error rate of 16.3\% [8.8–28.3\%]. With this error rate, deep-sequence phylogenetics cannot be used against individuals in legal contexts, but is sufficiently low for population-level inferences into the sources of epidemic spread. The technique presents new opportunities for characterizing source populations and for targeting of {HIV}-1 prevention interventions in Africa.},

	abstract = {Studying the evolution of viruses and their molecular epidemiology relies on accurate viral sequence data, so that small differences between similar viruses can be meaningfully interpreted. Despite its higher throughput and more detailed minority variant data, next-generation sequencing has yet to be widely adopted for {HIV}. The difﬁculty of accurately reconstructing the consensus sequence of a quasispecies from reads (short fragments of {DNA}) in the presence of large betweenand within-host diversity, including frequent indels, may have presented a barrier. In particular, mapping (aligning) reads to a reference sequence leads to biased loss of information; this bias can distort epidemiological and evolutionary conclusions. De novo assembly avoids this bias by aligning the reads to themselves, producing a set of sequences called contigs. However contigs provide only a partial summary of the reads, misassembly may result in their having an incorrect structure, and no information is available at parts of the genome where contigs could not be assembled. To address these problems we developed the tool shiver to pre-process reads for quality and contamination, then map them to a reference tailored to the sample using corrected contigs supplemented with the user’s choice of existing reference sequences. Run with two commands per sample, it can easily be used for large heterogeneous data sets. We used shiver to reconstruct the consensus sequence and minority variant information from paired-end short-read whole-genome data produced with the Illumina platform, for sixty-ﬁve existing publicly available samples and ﬁfty new samples. We show the systematic superiority of mapping to shiver’s constructed reference compared with mapping the same reads to the closest of 3,249 real references: median values of 13 bases called differently and more accurately, 0 bases called differently and less accurately, and 205 bases of missing sequence recovered. We also successfully applied shiver to whole-genome samples of Hepatitis C Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus. shiver is publicly available from https://github.com/{ChrisHIV}/shiver.},

The horseshoe prior is a member of the family of multivariate scale mixtures of normals, and is therefore closely related to widely used approaches for sparse Bayesian learning, including, among others, Laplacian priors (e.g. the LASSO) and Student-t priors (e.g. the relevance vector machine). The advantages of the horseshoe are its robustness at handling unknown sparsity and large outlying signals. These properties are justifed theoretically via a representation theorem and accompanied by comprehensive empirical experiments that compare its performance to benchmark alternatives.}

	abstract = {Background: Recombination between strains of {HIV}-1 only occurs in individuals with multiple infections, and the incidence of recombinant forms implies that multiple infection is common. Most direct studies indicate that multiple infection is rare. We determined the rate of multiple infection in a longitudinal study of 58 {HIV}-1 positive participants from The Women's Interagency {HIV} Study with a richer sampling design than previous direct studies, and we investigated the role of recombination and sampling design on estimating the multiple infection rate.
Results: 40\% of our sample had multiple {HIV}-1 infections. This rate of multiple infection is statistically consistent with previous studies once differences in sampling design are taken into account. Injection drug use significantly increased the incidence of multiple infections. In general there was rapid elimination of secondary strains to undetectable levels, but in 3 cases a superinfecting strain displaced the initial infecting strain and in two cases the strains coexisted throughout the study. All but one secondary strain was detected as an inter- and/or intra-genic recombinant. Injection drug use significantly increased the rate of observed recombinants.
Conclusion: Our multiple infection rate is consistent with rates estimated from the frequency of recombinant forms of {HIV}-1. The fact that our results are also consistent with previous direct studies that had reported a much lower rate illustrates the critical role of sampling design in estimating this rate. Multiple infection and recombination significantly add to the genetic diversity of {HIV}-1 and its evolutionary potential, and injection drug use significantly increases both.},

	abstract = {Elucidating virus-host interactions responsible for {HIV}-1 transmission is important for advancing {HIV}-1 prevention strategies. To this end, single genome amplification ({SGA}) and sequencing of {HIV}-1 within the context of a model of random virus evolution has made possible for the first time an unambiguous identification of transmitted/founder viruses and a precise estimation of their numbers. Here, we applied this approach to {HIV}-1 env analyses in a cohort of acutely infected men who have sex with men ({MSM}) and found that a high proportion (10 of 28; 36\%) had been productively infected by more than one virus. In subjects with multivariant transmission, the minimum number of transmitted viruses ranged from 2 to 10 with viral recombination leading to rapid and extensive genetic shuffling among virus lineages. A combined analysis of these results, together with recently published findings based on identical {SGA} methods in largely heterosexual ({HSX}) cohorts, revealed a significantly higher frequency of multivariant transmission in {MSM} than in {HSX} [19 of 50 subjects (38\%) versus 34 of 175 subjects (19\%); Fisher’s exact p = 0.008]. To further evaluate the {SGA} strategy for identifying transmitted/founder viruses, we analyzed 239 overlapping 59 and 39 half genome or env-only sequences from plasma viral {RNA} ({vRNA}) and blood mononuclear cell {DNA} in an {MSM} subject who had a particularly well-documented virus exposure history 3–6 days before symptom onset and 14–17 days before peak plasma viremia (47,600,000 {vRNA} molecules/ml). All 239 sequences coalesced to a single transmitted/founder virus genome in a time frame consistent with the clinical history, and a molecular clone of this genome encoded replication competent virus in accord with model predictions. Higher multiplicity of {HIV}-1 infection in {MSM} compared with {HSX} is consistent with the demonstrably higher epidemiological risk of virus acquisition in {MSM} and could indicate a greater challenge for {HIV}-1 vaccines than previously recognized.},

	abstract = {HIV incidence has been declining in Africa with scale-up of HIV interventions. However, there is limited data on HIV evolutionary trends in African populations with waning epidemics. We evaluated changes in HIV viral diversity and genetic divergence in southern Uganda over a twenty-five-year period spanning the introduction and scale-up of HIV prevention and treatment programs using HIV sequence and survey data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study, an open longitudinal population-based HIV surveillance cohort. Gag (p24) and env (gp41) HIV data were generated from persons living with HIV (PLHIV) in 31 inland semi-urban trading and agrarian communities (1994 to 2018) and four hyperendemic Lake Victoria fishing communities (2011 to 2018) under continuous surveillance. HIV subtype was assigned using the Recombination Identification Program with phylogenetic confirmation. Inter-subtype diversity was estimated using the Shannon diversity index and intra-subtype diversity with the nucleotide diversity and pairwise TN93 genetic distance. Genetic divergence was measured using root-to-tip distance and pairwise TN93 genetic distance analyses. Evolutionary dynamics were assessed among demographic and behavioral sub-groups, including by migration status. 9,931 HIV sequences were available from 4,999 PLHIV, including 3,060 and 1,939 persons residing in inland and fishing communities, respectively. In inland communities, subtype A1 viruses proportionately increased from 14.3\% in 1995 to 25.9\% in 2017 (p\&lt;0.001), while those of subtype D declined from 73.2\% in 1995 to 28.2\% in 2017 (p\&lt;0.001). The proportion of viruses classified as recombinants significantly increased by more than four-fold. Inter-subtype HIV diversity has generally increased. While p24 intra-subtype genetic diversity and divergence leveled off after 2014, diversity and divergence of gp41 increased through 2017. Inter- and intra-subtype viral diversity increased across all population sub-groups, including among individuals with no recent migration history or extra-community sexual partners. This study provides insights into population-level HIV evolutionary dynamics in declining African HIV epidemics following the scale-up of HIV prevention and treatment programs. Continued molecular surveillance may provide a better understanding of the dynamics driving population HIV evolution and yield important insights for epidemic control and vaccine development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study is supported by the Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH (R01AI110324, R01AI143333-01, R01AI155080-01A1, R01MH115799-02, R01HL152813-01A1), the HIV Prevention Trials Network Laboratory Center (UM1-AI068613), and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1175094, OPP1084362).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study protocol was approved by the Uganda Virus Research Institute Research and Ethics Committee, GC/127/08/12/137 (Kampala, Uganda), the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology, HS 540 (Kampala, Uganda), and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board IRB00217467 (Baltimore, Maryland, USA).

	abstract = {Background. Studying human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) superinfection is important to understand virus transmission, disease progression, and vaccine design. But detection remains challenging, with low sampling frequencies and insufﬁcient longitudinal samples.
Methods. Using the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS), we developed a molecular epidemiology screening for superinfections. A phylogeny built from 22 243 HIV-1 partial polymerase sequences was used to identify potential superinfections among 4575 SHCS participants with longitudinal sequences. A subset of potential superinfections was tested by near-full-length viral genome sequencing (NFVGS) of biobanked plasma samples.
Results. Based on phylogenetic and distance criteria, 325 potential HIV-1 superinfections were identiﬁed and categorized by their likelihood of being detected as superinfections due to sample misidentiﬁcation. NFVGS was performed for 128 potential superinfections; of these, 52 were conﬁrmed by NFVGS, 15 were not conﬁrmed, and for 61 sampling did not allow conﬁrming or rejecting superinfection because the sequenced samples did not include the relevant time points causing the superinfection signal in the original screen. Thus, NFVGS could support 52 of 67 adequately sampled potential superinfections.
Conclusions. This cohort-based molecular approach identiﬁed, to our knowledge, the largest population of conﬁrmed superinfections, showing that, while rare with a prevalence of 1\%–7\%, superinfections are not negligible events.},

	abstract = {Background. Human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) superinfection has been documented in high-risk individuals; however, the rate of superinfection among HIV-infected individuals within a general population remains unknown.
Methods. A novel next-generation ultra-deep sequencing technique was utilized to determine the rate of HIV superinfection in a heterosexual population by examining two regions of the viral genome in longitudinal samples from recent HIV seroconverters (n = 149) in Rakai District, Uganda.
Results. The rate of superinfection was 1.44 per 100 person years (PYs) (95\% conﬁdence interval [CI], .4–2.5) and consisted of both inter- and intrasubtype superinfections. This was compared to primary HIV incidence in 20 220 initially HIV-negative individuals in the general population in Rakai (1.15 per 100 PYs; 95\% CI, 1.1–1.2; P = .26). Propensity score matching (PS) was used to control for differences in sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics between the HIV-positive individuals at risk for superinfection and the HIV-negative population at baseline and follow-up. After PS matching, the estimated rate of primary incidence was 3.28 per 100 PYs (95\% CI, 2.0–5.3; P = .07) controlling for baseline differences and 2.51 per 100 PYs (95\% CI, 1.5–4.3; P = .24) controlling for follow-up differences.
Conclusions. This suggests that the rate of HIV superinfection in a general population is substantial, which could have a signiﬁcant impact on future public health and HIV vaccine strategies.},

Here, we developed a mathematical model of random viral evolution and, together with phylogenetic tree construction, used it to analyze 3,449 complete
              env
              sequences derived by single genome amplification from 102 subjects with acute HIV-1 (clade B) infection. Viral
              env
              genes evolving from individual transmitted or founder viruses generally exhibited a Poisson distribution of mutations and star-like phylogeny, which coalesced to an inferred consensus sequence at or near the estimated time of virus transmission. Overall, 78 of 102 subjects had evidence of productive clinical infection by a single virus, and 24 others had evidence of productive clinical infection by a minimum of two to five viruses. Phenotypic analysis of transmitted or early founder Envs revealed a consistent pattern of CCR5 dependence, masking of coreceptor binding regions, and equivalent or modestly enhanced resistance to the fusion inhibitor T1249 and broadly neutralizing antibodies compared with Envs from chronically infected subjects. Low multiplicity infection and limited viral evolution preceding peak viremia suggest a finite window of potential vulnerability of HIV-1 to vaccine-elicited immune responses, although phenotypic properties of transmitted Envs pose a formidable defense.},

Characterizing the neutralizing antibody ({nAb}) responses in four superinfected women revealed that superinfection does not boost memory {nAb} responses primed by the ﬁrst infection or promote {nAb} responses to epitopes conserved in both infecting viruses. While one superinfected individual developed potent {bnAbs}, superinfection was likely not the driver as the {nAb} response did not target an epitope conserved in both viruses. Rather, sequential exposure led to {nAbs} speciﬁc to each Env but did not promote {bnAb} development. Thus, sequential immunization with heterologous Envs may not be sufﬁcient to focus the immune response onto conserved epitopes.},

	abstract = {{HIV}-1 vaccines designed to date have failed to elicit neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) that are capable of protecting against globally diverse {HIV}-1 subtypes. One relevant setting to study the development of a strong, cross-reactive Nab response is {HIV}-1 superinfection ({SI}), defined as sequential infections from different source partners. {SI} has previously been shown to lead to a broader and more potent Nab response when compared to single infection, but it is unclear whether {SI} also impacts epitope specificity and if the epitopes targeted after {SI} differ from those targeted after single infection. Here the post-{SI} Nab responses were examined from 21 Kenyan women collectively exposed to subtypes A, C, and D and superinfected after a median time of {\textasciitilde}1.07 years following initial infection. Plasma samples chosen for analysis were collected at a median time point {\textasciitilde}2.72 years post-{SI}. Because previous studies of singly infected populations with broad and potent Nab responses have shown that the majority of their neutralizing activity can be mapped to 4 main epitopes on the {HIV}-1 Envelope, we focused on these targets, which include the {CD}4-binding site, a V1/ V2 glycan, the N332 supersite in V3, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41. Using standard epitope mapping techniques that were applied to the previous cohorts, the present study demonstrates that {SI} did not induce a dominant Nab response to any one of these epitopes in the 21 women. Computational sera delineation analyses also suggested that 20 of the 21 superinfected women’s Nab responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with high confidence. These data are consistent with a model in which {SI} with diverse subtypes promotes the development of a broad polyclonal Nab response, and thus would provide support for vaccine designs using multivalent {HIV} immunogens to elicit a diverse repertoire of Nabs.},

	abstract = {Identifying naturally-occurring neutralizing antibodies (NAb) that are cross-reactive against all global subtypes of HIV-1 is an important step toward the development of a vaccine. Establishing the host and viral determinants for eliciting such broadly NAbs is also critical for immunogen design. NAb breadth has previously been shown to be positively associated with viral diversity. Therefore, we hypothesized that superinfected individuals develop a broad NAb response as a result of increased antigenic stimulation by two distinct viruses. To test this hypothesis, plasma samples from 12 superinfected women each assigned to three singly infected women were tested against a panel of eight viruses representing four different HIV-1 subtypes at matched time points post-superinfection (,5 years post-initial infection). Here we show superinfected individuals develop significantly broader NAb responses post-superinfection when compared to singly infected individuals (RR = 1.68, CI: 1.23–2.30, p = 0.001). This was true even after controlling for NAb breadth developed prior to superinfection, contemporaneous CD4+ T cell count and viral load. Similarly, both unadjusted and adjusted analyses showed significantly greater potency in superinfected cases compared to controls. Notably, two superinfected individuals were able to neutralize variants from four different subtypes at plasma dilutions .1:300, suggesting that their NAbs exhibit elite activity. Crosssubtype breadth was detected within a year of superinfection in both of these individuals, which was within 1.5 years of their initial infection. These data suggest that sequential infections lead to augmentation of the NAb response, a process that may provide insight into potential mechanisms that contribute to the development of antibody breadth. Therefore, a successful vaccination strategy that mimics superinfection may lead to the development of broad NAbs in immunized individuals.},

	abstract = {Objective: HIV-1 superinfection occurs frequently in high-risk populations, but its clinical consequences remain poorly characterized. We undertook this study to determine the impact of HIV-1 superinfection on disease progression. Design/methods: In the largest prospective cohort study of superinfection to date, we compared measures of HIV-1 progression in women who acquired superinfection with those who did not. Clinical and laboratory data were collected at quarterly intervals. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare postacute viral load and CD4þ T-cell counts over time in singly infected and superinfected women. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to determine the effect of superinfection on time to clinical progression [CD4þ cell count {\textless}200 cells/ml, antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation or death].
Results: Among 144 women, 21 of whom acquired superinfection during follow-up, the rate of viral load increase was higher in superinfected than in singly infected women (P ¼ 0.0008). In adjusted analysis, superinfected women had lower baseline viral load before superinfection (P ¼ 0.05) and a trend for increased viral load at superinfection acquisition (P ¼ 0.09). We also observed a borderline association of superinfection with accelerated CD4þ cell count decline (P ¼ 0.06). However, there was no signiﬁcant difference in time to clinical progression events.
Conclusion: These data suggest that superinfection is associated with accelerated progression in laboratory measures of HIV-1 disease, but has a limited impact on the occurrence of clinical events. Our observation that superinfected individuals have lower baseline viral load prior to superinfection suggests that there may be host or viral determinants of susceptibility to superinfection.},

	abstract = {The human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) population is characterised by extensive genetic variability that results from high error and recombination rates of the reverse transcription process, and from the fast turnover of virions in HIV-infected individuals. Among the viral variants encountered at the global scale, recombinant forms are extremely abundant. Some of these recombinants (known as circulating recombinant forms) become ﬁxed and undergo rapid expansion in the population. The reasons underlying their epidemiological success remain at present poorly understood and constitute a fascinating area for future research to improve our understanding of immune escape, pathogenicity and transmission. Recombinant viruses are generated during reverse transcription as a consequence of template switching between the two genetically different genomic RNAs present in a heterozygous virus. Recombination can thereby generate shortcuts in evolution by producing mosaic reverse transcription products of parental genomes. Therefore, in a single infectious cycle multiple mutations that are positively selected can be combined or, conversely, negatively selected mutations can be removed. Recombination is therefore involved in different aspects of HIV evolution, adaptation to its host, and escape from antiviral treatments.},
